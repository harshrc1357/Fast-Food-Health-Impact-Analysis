# Data Visualization Project: Fast Food Health Impact Analysis

As **Team Lead** for a three-member research team, I spearheaded a comprehensive data visualization project analyzing the relationship between fast food chains and public health outcomes across the United States. The project examined over **10,000 restaurant locations** and their nutritional data from **August to December 2024**.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Analysis & Visualization
- Created interactive scatter plots and correlation matrices using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to demonstrate that **72% of menu items exceed daily nutritional limits**.
- Engineered heat map visualizations revealing urban areas with high restaurant density correlate to **3.5% higher obesity rates**.
- Developed a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline integrating geographic and nutritional datasets.

## Key Findings
- Revealed **McDonald's market dominance** with **28.8% presence** and concerning nutritional trends across chains.
- Demonstrated that areas with **500+ restaurants within a 50-mile radius** displayed **32% higher obesity rates**.
- Identified strong correlations (**r=0.82**) between calories and total fat content in menu items.

## Impact
The project provided **actionable insights** for public health officials and policymakers, highlighting critical relationships between fast food accessibility and community health outcomes. Our visualizations effectively communicated complex nutritional and geographic data patterns, supporting informed decision-making about fast food consumption and public health initiatives.
